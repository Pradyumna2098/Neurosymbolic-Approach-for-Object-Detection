## How to Update This Document

### When Starting Work on an Issue

1. Update the issue status from "Not Started" to "In Progress"
2. Add the start date
3. Update the "Last Updated" timestamp at the top of the document
4. Recalculate the overall completion percentage if needed

### When Completing an Issue

1. Update the issue status to "Complete"
2. Add the completion date
3. Check all acceptance criteria as complete
4. Update the "Last Updated" timestamp at the top
5. Recalculate the overall completion percentage:
   - Formula: `(Completed Issues / Total Issues) × 100`
